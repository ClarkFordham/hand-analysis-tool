# hand-analysis-tool

Hello and welcome to my hand analysis tool for online texas hold-em poker.

This application is currently a work-in-progress.

The design of this tool is as follows:
- able to collect hands from local files and save them in a database
- view and review hands in the database, as well as some general statistics about play
- run hands in the database through a GTO solver that mathematically analyzes play
- no current intentions to include a HUD in this application, but that may change

Currently not accepting any pull requests as this is a personal project at the moment.
